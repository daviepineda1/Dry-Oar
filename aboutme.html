        Hello everyone my name is David P. I am studying to get my Computer Science Degree and finish 
      my portfolio in Virtual Reality/ Augemented Reality technology. I love to go in the outdoors and 
      explore new places all over the world. My favorite sports to play are soccer, waterpolo, and volleyball.
      Although I am not married, it is something I won't be apposed to when the time is right.

        I am currently a student, but hopefully will finish the adequate bootcamp for XR development to 
        obtain an internship. This is my first year here in BYU-Idaho, so I am enjoying the new environment.

        It is crucial to know a little about everything in the field of computer science, because the more 
        knowledge the better. Web design is very useful to know how to work and read, even though their are 
        mulitple free templates to create a website. In this course, I want to further my understanding in 
        html and css stylying. When I need to create my own website to attach to my Linkdn account I will 
        hopefully known enough information to do so.

        church has always changed throughout the years.
