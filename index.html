        Rafting makes sure you get a picturesque view of the water, greenery, and the mountains. 
        The river usually lies between two mountains and takes care of giving you a splendid view of the nature around.
        Provides an adrenaline rush- Whitewater rafting guarantees a release of adrenaline. 
        Adrenaline rushes allow rafters to focus only on the excitement they feel rather than the physical exercise of rafting. Reduces stress â€“ Rafting provides you an escape from reality.

        White water rafting can be a dangerous sport, especially if basic safety precautions are not observed. It has its share of injuries and fatalities. 
        But like most ou r sports, rafting has become safer over the years. Expertise has increased, and equipment has become more specialised and better in quality.
        Risks in rafting stem from both environmental dangers and improper behaviour. Rafting is often played for the adrenaline rush and this often becomes a problem for people and their own safety. 
        Certain features on rivers are inherently unsafe and have remained consistently so despite the passage of time. These would include fallen trees, dams, rocks and high waterfalls.

       The strong and extreme current and turbulence in the water makes it very thrilling. 
       The main goal of this sport is to maneuver and navigate the raft through rapids or turbulent waters, often times taking you over rocks and drops, without capsizing the raft.
        Hopefully you ARE able to JOIN US!!
